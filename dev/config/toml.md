> Viper is a complete configuration solution for Go applications including 12-Factor apps. It is designed to work within an application, and can handle all types of configuration needs and formats. It supports:
> 
> * setting defaults
> * reading from JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, and Java properties config files
> * live watching and re-reading of config files (optional)
> * reading from environment variables
> * reading from remote config systems (etcd or Consul), and watching changes
> * reading from command line flags
> * reading from buffer
> * setting explicit values
>
> Viper can be thought of as a registry for all of your applications configuration needs.
